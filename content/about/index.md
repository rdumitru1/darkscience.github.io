Welcome to my blog.

As an experienced DevOps engineer with over 11 years of experience, my journey into the world of 
technology began humbly as a helpdesk operator, evolving into a proficient systems 
administrator. Along this path, my passion for open-source technologies has been unwavering, 
driving me to delve deep into the realm of Linux server administration, AWS cloud infrastructure, 
Kubernetes orchestration, and automation tools such as Terraform, Ansible and Jenkins.

Whether it's orchestrating complex deployments on Kubernetes clusters, automating 
infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, or implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, I thrive on 
leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive business outcomes and foster innovation. 

In addition to my professional pursuit as a DevOps engineer, I like to share technical insights 
and experimenting with various technologies in my home lab. Writing about technical topics 
has become a passion of mine, serving as a means to not only document my learnings but 
also to share knowledge with others in the community.
My home lab serves as a playground where I can replicate and explore intriguing concepts that 
catch my interest.
